      <li> I like to create things, and I figure html & css & js are some handy things to know! </li>
      <li> my knowledge of html is limited: I know how to italicize, skip a space, insert an image—the <br> 
        simple things—and I don't know anything about css nor js (besides what they are). </li>
      <li> I hope to better my skills in these three things (html/css/js) and be able to code my own site. </li>
      <li> designing on screen is more interactive than its paper counterpart. </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.ssense.com/" title="ssense">here's</a> a site I think exemplifies
      effective design. it's quite minimalistic and <br> 
      subsequently not gaudy; the images of the clothing and font are small and soft on the eye.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/" title="the paris review">here's</a> a site I think exemplifies
      effective communication. everything is organized <br> in such a way that finding what you want is an effortless
      process. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/" title="dictionary">here's</a> a site I think works well. I like its
      simplicity, how—after searching <br> a word—there is a drop down menu that allows you to view its synonyms & 
      antonyms <br> and translations while you are on it. it's wonderfully convenient. </li>
