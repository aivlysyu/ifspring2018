<p>In December 2014, an exhibition by Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo entitled <a href="https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/news/2014-kunsthalle-darknet/" target="_blank" class="memes">The Darknet: From Memes to Onionland"</a> explored Darknet culture. This featured a bot called the <a href="https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/r/" target="_blank" class="memes">"Random Darknet Shopper"</a> which spent $100 in BTC per week on products listed on Agora. Their aim was to explore the ethical and philosophical implications of these markets, which, despite high-profile internationally co-ordinated raids, persist and flourish.</p>

<p>James Martin's 2014 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Dark-Net-Cryptomarkets-Transforming/dp/113739904X" target="_blank" class="memes">Drugs on the Dark Net: How Cryptomarkets are Transforming the Global Trade in Illicit Drugs</a> discusses some vendors who are even branding their opium or cocaine as "fair trade," "organic" or sourced from conflict-free zones. In June 2015 journalist Jamie Bartlett gave a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream" target="_blank" class="memes">TED talk about the state of the darknet market ecosystem as it stands today.</a></p>
<br><br>
<p>According to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2436643" target="_blank" class="memes">2014 studies by Martin Aldridge & Décary-Hétu</a> and a January 2015 report from the Global Drug Policy Observatory, many harm reduction trends have been spotted. These include the reduced risks associated with street dealing such as being offered hard drugs. The vendor feedback system provides accountability for risks of mixing and side effects and protection against scammers. Online forum communities provide information about safe drug use in an environment where users can anonymously ask questions. Some users report the online element having a moderating affect on their consumption due to the increased lead time ordering from the sites compared to street dealing.</p>
<br><br>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-138148048.html" target="_blank" class="memes">Professor for addiction research Heino Stöver notes that the shops can be seen as a political statement, advancing drug legalization "from below."</a> The results of these markets are higher quality and lower prices of psychoactive substances as well as a lower risk of violent incidents. A number of studies suggest that markets such as Silk Road may have helped users reduce the harm caused by illicit drug use, particularly compared with street-based drug marketplaces. Examples include the sale of high-quality products with low risk for contamination (including lacing and cutting), vendor-tested products, sharing of trip reports, and online discussion of harm reduction practices. Some health professionals such as "DoctorX" provide information, advice and drug-testing services on the darknet. The quality of products is attributed to the competition and transparency of darknet markets which involve user feedback and reputation features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rbijou.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/JIR1502-F8-Darknet.pdf" target="_blank" class="memes">Europol reported in December 2014, "We have lately seen a large amount of physical crime move online, at least the 'marketing' and delivery part of the business ... [Buyers can] get the illegal commodity delivered risk-free to a place of their choice by the mailman or a courier, or maybe by drone in the future, and can pay with virtual currency and in full anonymity, without the police being able to identify either the buyer or the seller."</a></p>

<p>In June 2015 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) produced <a href="http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/edr/trends-developments/2015/online/chapter1" target="_blank" class="memes">a report citing difficulties controlling virtual market places via darknet markets, social media and mobile apps.</a> In August 2015 it was announced that <a href="https://darkwebnews.com/news/interpol-dark-web-training-course/" target="_blank" class="memes">Interpol now offers a dedicated Dark Web training program featuring technical information on Tor and cybersecurity and simulated darknet market takedowns.</a></p>
<br><br>
<p>In October 2015 the UK's National Crime Agency and GCHQ announced <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2445814/Secrets-UKs-new-FBI-Police-chief-reveals-elite-force-5-000-super-agents-wage-high-tech-manhunt-Britains-wanted-criminals.html" target="_blank" class="memes">the formation of a "Joint Operations Cell" to focus on cybercrime.</a> In November 2015 this team would be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In February 2015, the EMCDDA produced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/online-market-turning-drug-dealers-goons-geeks-darknet" target="_blank" class="memes">another report citing the increased importance of customer service and reputation management in the marketplace, the reduced risk of violence and increased product purity.</a> It estimated a quarter of all purchases were for resale and that the trend towards decentralisation meant they are unlikely to be eliminated any time soon.</p>
<br><br>
<p>A June 2016 <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8q88wv/more-people-than-ever-say-they-get-their-drugs-on-the-dark-web" target="_blank" class="memes">report from the Global Drug Survey described how the markets are increasing in popularity, despite ongoing law enforcement action and scams. Other findings include consumers making purchases via friends operating Tor browser and Bitcoin payments, rather than directly. Access to markets in 79% of respondents' cases led to users trying a new type of drug.</a> <span id="blink2">|</span></p>
