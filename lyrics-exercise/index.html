    if I could, I'd be your little spoon <br>
    and kiss your fingers forevermore <br>
    but, big spoon, you have so much to do <br>
    and I have nothing ahead of me <br>
    you're the sun, you've never seen the night <br>
    but you hear its song from the morning birds <br>
    well I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star <br>
    but awake at night I'll be singing to the birds <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    don't wait for me, I can't come <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me <br>
    but I do, I think I do <br>
    and you're an all-american boy <br>
    I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best american girl <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    you're the one <br>
    you're all I ever wanted <br>
    I think I'll regret this <br><br>
    </p> 
    
    <p>
    your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me <br>
    but I do, I finally do <br>
    and you're an all-american boy <br>
    I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best american girl <br>
    your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me <br>
    but I do, I think I do
