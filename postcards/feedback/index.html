	<h3>notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The text of postcards #1 and 3 could utilize the image more, i.e. wrap around the men rather than simply being displayed right over them or above them.</li>
		<li>Sizing of postcards #2 and #3 is off: Leslie appears compressed in the mobile version of the second postcard, and Tom appears stretched in the desktop version of the third postcard. Consider resizing the images so that they are not distorted, or using the magic wand tool in Photoshop to cut the person out and position them on a different / solid-colored background.</li>
		<li>Perhaps distinguish the quote and who said the quote, and add more space in between the two to give them greater contrast as two different pieces of information.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>(and notes for myself)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Contrast for text on first postcard (e.g. text shadow). Utilizing space for mobile version.</li>
		<li>Larger font size for mobile-version of third postcard.</li>
	</ul>
